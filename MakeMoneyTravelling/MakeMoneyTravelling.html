    <h3>3 | Work in a Hostel</h3>
    <p>
        Hostels are a great way to earn some hard cash! Some new staff is often needed even for a few hours only.
        In exchange for taking care of the front desk or cleaning, you can expect at least a free lodging.
        <h4>How to be hired by hostel managers?</h4>
        
        Simply go ask them if they need help for the day or during the week and offer to help with housekeeping.
        
        Even better:
        If you have a driving license, offer to organize airport pickups!
        Competition between accommodation suppliers is often harsh and this kind of service can make a difference for their customers.
        
        Don't forget to mention all the languages that you speak, it might also be very valuable for them.
        And a reason more for you to ask for a paycheck in addition to a free bed.<br><br>
